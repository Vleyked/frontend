Exercise: Create a Personal Profile Page
Objective: Design a simple personal profile page using HTML, showcasing your name, a brief biography, a list of hobbies, and a contact section.

Requirements:

Document Structure:

Use the <!DOCTYPE html> declaration.
Include the <html>, <head>, and <body> tags.
Inside the <head> tag, set the page title to "Profile of [Your Name]".
Profile Header:

Use a level-1 heading (<h1>) to display your name.
Below your name, use a level-2 heading (<h2>) to display the text "About Me".
Include a paragraph (<p>) with a brief biography.
Hobbies Section:

Use a level-2 heading (<h2>) to display the text "My Hobbies".
Create an ordered list (<ol>) or unordered list (<ul>) that lists at least three of your hobbies.
Contact Section:

Use a level-2 heading (<h2>) to display the text "Contact Me".
Add a paragraph with a fictional email address. However, here's the challenge: Use the <a> tag to make the email clickable, so it opens a new email when clicked. (Hint: Use the mailto: scheme.)
Images:

Integrate an image of yourself or any placeholder image. Ensure you add the alt attribute to describe the image.
Bonus:

Add a table (<table>) under a new level-2 heading "My Schedule". The table should have columns for days of the week and typical activities you do on those days.
Use the <th> tag for table headers.
    
Evaluation Criteria:

Correct use of HTML tags.
Proper indentation and formatting.
Presence of all required sections.
Functionality of the clickable email link.
This exercise will help beginners understand the basic structure of an HTML document, the purpose and usage of common tags, and the significance of attributes like alt.
The bonus section introduces tables, which can be a bit tricky but offers a good challenge.
