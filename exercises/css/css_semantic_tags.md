Exercise: Styling and Enhancing the Personal Portfolio
Objective: Refine the personal profile page you created in the previous exercise by adding CSS styles and further enhancing its structure using semantic HTML tags.

Requirements:

Document Structure and Semantics:

Ensure your document structure is organized using semantic tags like <header>, <footer>, <nav>, <section>, <article>, and <aside>.
Update the <head> section to link to an external CSS file named styles.css.
Styling the Header:

Set a background color for the <header> element.
Center the text within the header.
Apply a different font size for the name (<h1>) and "About Me" (<h2>).
Add some margin or padding to space out the elements.
Styling the Hobbies Section:

Use a different bullet style for the hobbies list (e.g., square or circle).
Add padding between the list items.
Use a different font family for this section.
Styling the Contact Section:

Style the email link to have a distinct color.
Add a hover effect for the email link, such as changing the color or adding an underline.
Styling the Image:

Add a border around the image.
Apply some border-radius to make the image appear as a circle.
Ensure the image is centered in its section.
Bonus: Styling the Schedule Table:

Add borders to the table and individual cells.
Use alternate colors for even and odd rows to improve readability.
Center the text within the table cells.
Footer:

Ensure the footer spans the entire width of the page.
Add a background color to differentiate it from the rest of the content.
Center the text in the footer.
Hints:

Use CSS properties like margin, padding, font-family, color, list-style-type, text-align, and border to achieve the desired styles.
The :hover pseudo-class can be used to add interactive hover effects.
The :nth-child(odd) and :nth-child(even) pseudo-classes can be helpful for styling alternate table rows.
Evaluation Criteria:

Proper use of semantic HTML tags.
Organized and clean CSS code.
Effective use of CSS properties to achieve the desired styles.
The overall aesthetic and visual appeal of the webpage.
Submission: Save your HTML code in a file named profile.html and your CSS in styles.css. Submit both files.

This exercise will help learners apply their CSS skills while reinforcing the importance of semantic HTML. They'll be able to experiment with different styles and see how CSS can transform the look and feel of a webpage.
